# Entry 7: How To Structure My Code

## What is needed for my code?
- [ ] Make the tennis ball appear randomly. I plan on referring to this game, [Reactoroids](https://react.rocks/example/Reacteroids),
that makes different shapes of rocks appear at a random place.
- [ ] Make a default tennis ball on the top side of the screen. When the bouncing tennis ball touches it, it will then
move to a random location.
- [ ] Make a background image.

## What is going on right now?
Although, looking and referring to game codes is useful. It is hard to comprehend the code. Thus, I look back
on the Codecademy lessons. 

Right now, I am trying to get 2 images appear at the same time. However, I am having troubles in making the
two images work different functions. Right now, I want the tennis player to be at default where it would not
move with the tennis ball. This is what I see right now: 

![test pic](/pics/tennis-player1.png)
![test pic](/pics/tennis-player2.png)

Thus, I was planning on making a new div that would go behind all the code. Unfortunately, this did not work out. My phone keeps
getting an error message when this occurs. 

As I tweaked the code some more, I realized the reason why all of my images, including my button, moves together
is because I have an onPress function that does this action. So, I took out the score part of the code and now, my pictures
are at default.

## Takeaways
* I think I am at the point where I need to start tweaking my own code. Right now, my code is too similar to the
Chewbacca app. I realized I spent too much time on the render part of the code instead of the actual code.
