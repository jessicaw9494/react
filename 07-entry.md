# Entry 7: How To Structure My Code

## What is needed for my code?
- [ ] Make the tennis ball appear randomly. I plan on referring to this game, [Reactoroids](https://react.rocks/example/Reacteroids),
that makes different shapes of rocks appear at a random place.
- [ ] Make a default tennis ball on the top side of the screen. When the bouncing tennis ball touches it, it will then
move to a random location.
- [ ] Make a background image.

## What is going on right now?
Although, looking and referring to game codes is useful. It is hard to comprehend the code. Thus, I look back
on the Codecademy lessons. 

Right now, I am trying to get 2 images appear at the same time. However, I am having troubles in making the
two images work different functions. Right now, I want the tennis player to be at default where it would not
move with the tennis ball. This is what I see right now:
