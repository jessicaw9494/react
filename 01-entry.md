# Entry 1: Introduction to React
This week I spent my time on choosing a topic that sparks to me the most. I have always wanted to create
my own app and I found out that React is a Javascript language that is used to code games and can be 
turned into an app! 

## What is react?
React is a Javascript programming language. Apps such as Instagram is made entirely out of React. 
Furthermore, the mini games on Facebook messenger are also made from React.

## What app should I make?
Know that Facebook uses React to make their messenger games, I want to make an app similar to their simple,
addictive sports game. So far, Facebook has a soccer and basketball game where the user taps the bouncing ball 
and win points every time they are able to catch the ball. However, they do not have a tennis game. Thus, 
I want to create a tennis game using React.

## Takeaways
I learned what apps uses React and based off this information, I can brainstorm what sort of app I plan to make.
